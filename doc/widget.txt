Widget defines the how should Angel present data from a defined RRD.

Again, widgets are created in admin portal.

Server & Category are optional fields. Rrd and Graph def are critical here.

A sample graph widget showing single line will be:
DEF:online={rrd}:online:LAST
LINE:online#ff8882:Online


Above definition actually follows rrdtool's graph parameter (http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdgraph.en.html)

{rrd} will be replaced with actual rrd file name.
